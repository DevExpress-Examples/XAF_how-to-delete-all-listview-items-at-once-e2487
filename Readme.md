# How to delete all ListView items at once


<p>This example illustrates the capability to clear the actual ListView content programmatically. It's recommended to create a separate ObjectSpace instance for this purpose (please check the DeleteAllItemsController implementation in the platform-independent DeleteAllListViewItems.Module). The "Delete All" action is enabled automatically, depending on the ListView content. In addition, the actual filter expression applied to the ListView is taken into account.</p>
